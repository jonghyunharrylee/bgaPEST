Approaches in Highly Parameterized Inversion: bgaPEST, a Bayesian Geostatistical Approach 
Implementation With PEST—Documentation and Instructions
By Michael N. Fienen, Marco D’Oria, John E. Doherty, and Randall J. Hunt
Techniques and Methods, Book 7, Section C9
Published 2013
<a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/07/c09">http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/07/c09</a></p>

<p>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Create an input file, following the documentation, with the .bgp extension
2) Copy bgaPEST.exe to the directory in which the problem is to run
2a) If using derivmode=0, also copy pest.exe and pst_generator.exe into the run directory
3) Type bgaPEST.exe .bgp at the command line to run</p>

<p>The subdirectories in this directory contain the following:
1_EXECUTABLES
This folder has subdirectory containing a 32-bit and 64-bit version of bgaPEST.exe, compiled
for Windows using the Intel Visual Fortran Compiler in Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>

<p>2_EXAMPLES
This subdirectory contains the input and executable files needed to run the examples presented
in the report cited above. Furthermore, an example using the parallel facility that uses
HTCondor is included and a fully 3-D version of the 3 layer problem is also included.</p>

<p>3_SOURCE
This subdirectory includes a file bgaPEST.sln for use as a solution file with Visual Studio 10.
The src subdirectory contains all Fortran source code used for bgaPEST. The inschek subdirectory 
is a double-precision version of the PEST utility inschek for use with the parallel option of
bgaPEST. Finally, in the src subdirectory is a python subdirectory containing the source code 
for pst_generator and the parallel CHTCondor utilities.</p>
