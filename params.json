Fienen, Marco D’Oria, John E. Doherty, and Randall J. Hunt\r\nTechniques and Methods, Book 7, Section C9\r\nPublished 2013\r\nhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/07/c09\r\n\r\nGENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n1) Create an input file, following the documentation, with the .bgp extension\r\n2) Copy bgaPEST.exe to the directory in which the problem is to run\r\n2a) If using derivmode=0, also copy pest.exe and pst_generator.exe into the run directory\r\n3) Type bgaPEST.exe <casename>.bgp at the command line to run\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subdirectories in this directory contain the following:\r\n1_EXECUTABLES\r\nThis folder has subdirectory containing a 32-bit and 64-bit version of bgaPEST.exe, compiled\r\nfor Windows using the Intel Visual Fortran Compiler in Microsoft Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n2_EXAMPLES\r\nThis subdirectory contains the input and executable files needed to run the examples presented\r\nin the report cited above. Furthermore, an example using the parallel facility that uses\r\nHTCondor is included and a fully 3-D version of the 3 layer problem is also included.\r\n\r\n3_SOURCE\r\nThis subdirectory includes a file bgaPEST.sln for use as a solution file with Visual Studio 10.\r\nThe src subdirectory contains all Fortran source code used for bgaPEST. The inschek subdirectory \r\nis a double-precision version of the PEST utility inschek for use with the parallel option of\r\nbgaPEST. Finally, in the src subdirectory is a python subdirectory containing the source code \r\nfor pst_generator and the parallel CHTCondor utilities.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER and NOTICE\r\nPlease refer to the USGS Software User Rights Notice (http://water.usgs.gov/software/help/notice/) for complete use, copyright, and distribution information.
